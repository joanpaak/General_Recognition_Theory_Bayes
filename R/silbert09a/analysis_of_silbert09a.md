## Discussion

There doesn't seem to be evidence of any interactions between the means of the latent distributions in either of the models. At least anything that could be distinguished among the remainig uncertainty about the locations. 

The posterior distributions for the correlation coefficients are faily wide, indicating lack of strong evidence to way or the other.

In the model with four rhos the posterior distribution for the stimulus "high, short" seems to be slightly tilted towards negative values, suggesting that there might be a negative correlation between these responses. However, the evidence is not strong enough to make decisive inferences.
